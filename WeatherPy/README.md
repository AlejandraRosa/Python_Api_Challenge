# WeatherPy Observations


## City Latitude vs Max Temperature(F)


![Lat_vs_temp](https://github.com/AlejandraRosa/Python_Api_Challenge/blob/master/WeatherPy/output_data/max_temp_latitude.png)

Maximum temperature for cities located near the equator (between latitude -20 and 0) is significantly higher than cities farther away from equator. We see a direct relationship between distance to the equator and temperature, the farther the city is to the equator, the colder the temparature.

## City Latitude vs Humidity

Altough we dont necesarily see a pattern between cities' latitude and humidity, we notice a higher amount of cities with higher humidity levels - the majority of the cities have humidity percentage of 60 and above. 

## City Latitude vs Cloudiness

When analyzing Latitude vs Cloudiness, we do not see a relationship between latitude and cloudiness. When comparing diffferent cities that fall within the same latitude, we see a wide range of cloudiness percentage, both on the extreme high and extreme low ends. 

## City Latitude vs Wind Speed (mph)

All cities fall within the 0-25 mpH wind speed with with only one outlier - Nanortalik, Greenland* (46.64 mph wind speed). Similar to Humidity and Cloudiness plots, we don't necesarily see a relationship between Latitude and Wind Speed.
